# Locale
A Locale represents a language and region. It can also contain additional information, such as currency, calendar, and user-added custom data.

Locales wrap the .Net [CultureInfo](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.globalization.cultureinfo) class. However, you can also define a custom Locale that the CultureInfo class does not support.
